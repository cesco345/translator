This is an application that helps you to learn a foreign language in a gamified way. It helps you identify words from different languages based on the idea of Carnegie Mellon University professor Luis von Ahn and Vadim Savin video lectures. Regarding the mascot Duo, do not worry, Duo will not be hounding you with reminder notifications. You will not be stalked by Duo and he will not threaten you if you stop using the app.
